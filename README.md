# Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-Heterogeneous-Time-Series

## Annotation: 

The vast majority of natural and artificial systems are open, dissipative, and nonequilibrium. Systems endowed with such properties belong to complex systems. A feature of such systems is their ability to generate non-uniform time series, i.e., time series characterized by the presence of abrupt and/or extraordinary events as well as scale-invariant (fractal) structure. This course is devoted to the study of methods and algorithms for the analysis and prediction of stationary and nonstationary heterogeneous time series
